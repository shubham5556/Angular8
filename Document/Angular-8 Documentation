*What is Angular 8?
Angular 8 is a client-side TypeScript based framework which is used to create dynamic web applications. The main purpose of angular is create SPA(single page application).

*Prerequisite for Angular 8 
 You must have installed Node.js version > 10. NPM will be updated also because it will be used by default.

*You can check your node, angular,& npm versions by using the following commands:
To check Node and Angular CLI version used
==> ng --version command.
To check npm version used
==> node -v command. 

*Create an Angular 8 project
Let's create an Angular 8 project by using the following command:
==> ng new angular8project  

*Install npm using the following command
==> cd projectname(inside the project)
==> npm install

*Run the project using following command
==> ng serve --o

*Install Bootstrap 4 CSS framework
Use the following command to install bootstrap in your project.
==> npm install bootstrap --save 

Now, add the following code inside the angular.json file.
"styles": [  
   "src/styles.css",  
   "./node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"  
 ],  


*Start the Angular development server using the following command.
==> ng serve -o  
Now the server will automatically starts at the http://localhost:4200/

*Generate Angular Components
Use the following command to generate Angular Components:
==> ng g c component_name 

*The components are automatically added to app.module.ts file. Now, we have to configure the routing of angular components inside an app-routing.module.ts file.

You can check the app-routing.module.ts file inside the src >> app folder in your project file. It is created because when we install an angular app, we permit angular cli to generate the routing file for us.


# create routes (app-routing.module.ts)
# router-outlet (app.component.html)
# listed the name of created componenet and anything we import (app.module.ts)
# call REST API (data.service.ts)
# baseURL (enviornment.ts)
