Angular 4
 Angular is a javascript comoponent based framework which is mainly used to developed single page application(SPA).
 Because of Angular we need typescript becuase of type ambiguity in javascript.
 i.e. Javascript is a dynamically type language it means that, we don't need to define the data type. 
 Where as, Typescript is a statically type language it means that we require to define data type before used the variables.
 But every browser only understand javascript beacuase they have its own javascript engine so 
 in angular we write a code in typescript and compile it into javasript using tsc(typescript compiler).

1. To install Angular, we require the following −
   =>Nodejs (Node.js is an open source server environment.Node.js allows you to run JavaScript on the server.
	     Node allows you to spin up a lightweight web server to host your application locally in your system.)
   =>Npm    (NPM (Node Package Manager) comes with node.js by default)
   =>Angular CLI (Angular CLI is a great tool for scaffolding your application. So, you don't need to write boilerplates manually.)
   =>IDE for writing your code(used visual studio code)

2. To check if nodejs is installed on your system, type
   =>node –v

   if not then download & install it from the following link
   =>https://nodejs.org/en/download/

3. Once nodejs is installed, npm will also get installed along with it.
   To check if npm is installed or not, type
   =>npm –v 

4. To insatll the angular cli on your system type
   =>sudo npm install -g @angular/cli

   To check whether Angular CLI is installed or not
   =>ng --version

5. To create a new project
   =>ng new projectname

   To create a fake REST API, install JSON server
   =>sudo npm install -g json-server 

   To change the port of json server
   =>json-server -p 5555 products.json

6. let us compile our project with the following command 
   =>ng serve
	
   To let it automatically open the browser window running the angular application
   =>ng serve --open

7. Type the url http://localhost:4200/ in the browser and see the output

8. To create the component
   =>ng g component component-name (g means generate)
     component is nothing but the custom tag

9. Install Bootstrap In Angular
   => first check in node_modules bootstrap is installed or not.
   => goto project directory using cmd
   => then run the command (npm install bootstrap --save)
   => after successfully install include the path in the angular.json file
